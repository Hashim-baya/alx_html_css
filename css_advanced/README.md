My first project after learning html and css.
This project only involved the use of html to write the content of the website  and css to style the website without the use of javascript.
This is a project that I created at ALX as a part of learning web development.
This project included different aspects of html such as use of semantic html, and making use of SEO(Search Engine Optimization).
This project also helped me learn different aspects of CSS such as use of selectors, in styling and also in understanding the box model to style different parts of the project.
